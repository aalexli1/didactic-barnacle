# End-to-End Testing Report: iOS App with Local Backend Integration

## Test Date
2025-08-15

## Executive Summary
Conducted end-to-end testing setup for AR Treasure Hunt iOS application with local backend integration. While the iOS app was successfully configured for local development, complete testing was blocked due to Docker Desktop not being available to run backend services.

## Configuration Changes Made

### iOS App Configuration
✅ **Updated API Client Base URL**
- Changed from: `https://api.artreasurehunt.com/v1`
- Changed to: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Location: `/didactic-barnicle-ios/didactic-barnicle-ios/Services/APIClient.swift`

### Backend Configuration Status
⚠️ **Docker Services Setup**
- Docker CLI is installed (version 28.3.3)
- Docker Desktop is NOT installed - preventing container execution
- Backend requires PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension and Redis
- Docker Compose configuration is properly defined in `backend/docker-compose.yml`

## Issues Identified

### 1. Duplicate File Conflicts in iOS Project
**Problem:** Multiple duplicate Swift files exist in the project structure causing build failures
**Files Affected:**
- `ProfileView.swift` (3 duplicates found)
  - `/Screens/Profile/ProfileView.swift`
  - `/Views/ProfileView.swift`
  - `/Views/Profile/ProfileView.swift`
- `ARCameraView.swift` (2 duplicates found)
  - `/Screens/Discovery/ARCameraView.swift`
  - `/Views/ARCameraView.swift`
- `MainTabView.swift` (2 duplicates found)
  - `/Screens/Main/MainTabView.swift`
  - `/Views/MainTabView.swift`

**Impact:** Xcode build fails with "Multiple commands produce" errors

### 2. Docker Desktop Not Available
**Problem:** Docker Desktop is not installed on the test machine
**Impact:** Cannot run backend services locally using Docker Compose
**Alternative Solutions:**
1. Install Docker Desktop manually
2. Set up PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and Redis manually
3. Use cloud-hosted backend services

### 3. Info.plist Configuration Issue
**Problem:** Build process shows duplicate Info.plist processing
**Impact:** May cause build instability

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Remove Duplicate Files**
   - Clean up duplicate Swift files in the iOS project
   - Ensure only one copy of each view file exists
   - Update project references in Xcode

2. **Backend Setup Options**
   - **Option A:** Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - **Option B:** Manually install and configure:
     - PostgreSQL 15+ with PostGIS extension
     - Redis server
     - Configure environment variables
     - Run database migrations

3. **iOS Project Cleanup**
   - Remove derived data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`
   - Clean build folder in Xcode
   - Rebuild project after removing duplicates

### Testing Strategy Once Setup Complete

#### Authentication Testing
- [ ] User registration flow
- [ ] Login with credentials
- [ ] Sign in with Apple
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Password reset flow

#### Core Features Testing
- [ ] Create new treasure
- [ ] Discover nearby treasures
- [ ] AR camera functionality (limited in simulator)
- [ ] Mark treasures as found
- [ ] View treasure details

#### Social Features Testing
- [ ] Send friend requests
- [ ] Accept/reject friend requests
- [ ] View friends list
- [ ] Activity feed updates
- [ ] Real-time notifications

#### Data Persistence Testing
- [ ] Core Data local storage
- [ ] Sync with backend API
- [ ] Offline mode functionality
- [ ] Data conflict resolution

## Test Environment Details

### iOS App
- **Xcode Version:** Xcode-beta
- **Target SDK:** iOS 26.0 (Simulator)
- **Swift Version:** 5.0
- **Architecture:** arm64, x86_64

### Backend Requirements
- **Node.js:** 18+
- **PostgreSQL:** 15+ with PostGIS 3.3
- **Redis:** 7-alpine
- **Port Configuration:**
  - Backend API: 3000
  - PostgreSQL: 5432
  - Redis: 6379

## Next Steps

1. **User Action Required:** Install Docker Desktop to enable backend services
2. **Developer Action:** Remove duplicate files from iOS project
3. **Automated Testing:** Once environment is set up, implement automated UI tests
4. **Performance Testing:** Monitor API response times and app performance
5. **Security Testing:** Verify JWT authentication and API security

## Conclusion

The iOS app has been successfully configured for local development testing. However, complete end-to-end testing requires:
1. Docker Desktop installation for backend services
2. Resolution of duplicate file conflicts in the iOS project
3. Manual verification of all test scenarios once environment is operational

The application architecture is well-structured with proper separation between iOS frontend and Node.js backend, supporting comprehensive testing once the environment issues are resolved.
