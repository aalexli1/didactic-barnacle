I've created a comprehensive project specification document that captures all the requirements and decisions from the inception discussion. The SPEC.md includes:

**Key Sections:**
- **Project Overview**: Clear description of the mobile companion app goals
- **User Stories**: Four core user stories covering task monitoring, details, creation, and configuration
- **Functional Requirements**: Five detailed requirements (FR-001 through FR-005) with specific acceptance criteria
- **Technical Architecture**: SwiftUI client with FastAPI backend integration
- **Success Criteria**: Performance and UX metrics for measuring success
- **Milestones**: Four-phase delivery plan (M1-M4) with clear deliverables

**Notable Features:**
- All requirements are specific, implementable, and testable
- Clear performance targets (2-second load times, real-time streaming)
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
- Explicit scope boundaries and out-of-scope items
- Detailed technical constraints and assumptions

The specification transforms the inception discussion into an actionable development roadmap that maintains the incremental, demo-friendly approach while ensuring all technical requirements are clearly defined.
