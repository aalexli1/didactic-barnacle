I've created a comprehensive project specification document for the Mobile Companion App. The SPEC.md includes:

## Key Sections Covered:

**Project Overview** - Clear description of the mobile app for orchestrator monitoring

**Goals & Success Metrics** - Specific performance targets (2-second load times, WebSocket fallback)

**User Stories** - Four main user stories covering monitoring, debugging, remote task creation, and configuration

**Functional Requirements** - Detailed F1-F5 sections covering:
- Task list screen with pull-to-refresh
- Task detail with live logs and WebSocket streaming  
- Task creation flow with validation
- Settings management with URL persistence
- Comprehensive error handling

**Technical Architecture** - SwiftUI framework, URLSession networking, data models, and backend integration details

**Success Criteria** - Four milestone-based acceptance criteria from core functionality through optional advanced features

**Development Phases** - 8-week timeline broken into foundation, core features, real-time capabilities, and polish

**Quality Assurance** - Testing strategy, code quality standards, and deployment approach

The specification transforms the inception discussion into actionable, testable requirements while maintaining the incremental, demo-friendly approach requested. Each requirement is specific, implementable, and includes clear success criteria.
