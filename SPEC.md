I've created a comprehensive project specification document that captures all the requirements and decisions from the inception discussion. The SPEC.md includes:

**Key Sections:**
- **Project Overview** - Clear description of the mobile companion app purpose
- **Goals and Objectives** - Primary goals with measurable success metrics
- **User Stories** - Four core user stories for task monitoring and creation
- **Detailed Requirements** - Functional (FR-1 through FR-5) and non-functional requirements
- **Technical Architecture** - iOS SwiftUI implementation with FastAPI backend integration
- **Success Criteria** - Specific acceptance criteria including performance targets
- **Constraints and Assumptions** - Technical and business limitations
- **Out of Scope** - Explicitly excluded MVP features like push notifications
- **Milestones** - Four-phase implementation plan (M1-M4)

The specification is structured to be actionable and testable, with clear performance targets (2-second load times), specific API endpoints, and comprehensive error handling requirements. Each requirement is numbered for easy reference during implementation.
