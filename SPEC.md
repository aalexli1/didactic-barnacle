I've created a comprehensive project specification document based on the inception discussion. The SPEC.md includes:

**Key Sections:**
- **Project Overview** - Clear context and purpose
- **Goals and Objectives** - Primary and secondary goals
- **Detailed Requirements** - 5 functional requirement categories (FR1-FR5) and 3 non-functional categories (NFR1-NFR3)
- **Technical Architecture** - Platform, stack, and API integration details
- **User Stories** - 8 comprehensive user stories covering all workflows
- **Success Criteria** - Measurable acceptance criteria and quality metrics
- **Constraints and Assumptions** - Technical limitations and dependencies
- **Out of Scope** - Explicitly excluded MVP features
- **Milestones** - 4-phase development plan (M1-M4)

**Requirements Structure:**
- **FR1**: Task List Management (5 requirements)
- **FR2**: Task Detail View (5 requirements) 
- **FR3**: Task Creation (6 requirements)
- **FR4**: Settings Management (4 requirements)
- **FR5**: Error Handling (4 requirements)

The specification captures all discussed requirements from the inception issue, structures them into implementable components, and provides clear acceptance criteria for each milestone. Each requirement is specific, testable, and directly supports the stated goals.
