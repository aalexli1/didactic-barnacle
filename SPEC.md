I've created a comprehensive project specification document that captures all the requirements from the inception discussion. The SPEC.md includes:

**Key Sections:**
- **Project Overview** - Clear description of the mobile companion app
- **Goals & Objectives** - Primary and secondary goals with focus on task visibility and remote interaction
- **User Stories** - 4 main user stories covering task monitoring, log viewing, task creation, and configuration
- **Detailed Requirements** - 23 specific functional requirements organized by feature area
- **Technical Architecture** - SwiftUI client with FastAPI backend integration
- **Success Criteria** - Measurable acceptance criteria and definition of done
- **Implementation Milestones** - 4 phased approach from core functionality to optional enhancements

**Structured Requirements:**
- **FR-01**: Task List Management (5 requirements)
- **FR-02**: Task Detail View (6 requirements) 
- **FR-03**: Task Creation (5 requirements)
- **FR-04**: Configuration Management (4 requirements)
- **FR-05**: Error Handling (4 requirements)

Each requirement is clear, specific, implementable, and testable as requested. The specification addresses the discussion thread issues and provides a complete roadmap for building the mobile companion app.
