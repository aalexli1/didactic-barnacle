This is the highest priority issue available and bugs that affect core functionality like authentication should be addressed immediately. While CLAUDE.md is missing (which would normally be P0 for project initialization), there's no explicit inception issue for it, and a critical authentication bug takes precedence over documentation setup. After fixing this critical bug, I should recommend creating CLAUDE.md for future development standards.

While CLAUDE.md is missing and should be P0, no issue exists for it in the available list. Issue #20 will establish the foundational contracts needed for all user management work.

CLAUDE.md establishes project conventions, architecture decisions, and coding standards that all future work should follow. This is a blocking dependency for quality development - without it, subsequent implementations may not follow consistent patterns. As an inception task, it also ensures the project has proper documentation structure before any feature development begins.
