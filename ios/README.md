# iOS App Scaffold

This directory now contains a minimal Swift Package executable target (`DidacticBarnacleApp`) to provide a basic Xcodeâ€‘openable structure. You can open `Package.swift` directly in Xcode and evolve it into a full SwiftUI app.

Quick start
- Open in Xcode: open `ios/Package.swift`
- Build from CLI: `cd ios && swift build`
- Run from CLI: `cd ios && swift run`

Notes
- For a traditional Xcode project, consider using XcodeGen to generate an `.xcodeproj` from a spec. For now, the Swift Package provides an immediately usable structure.

See `specs.md` for the initial scope and milestones.
